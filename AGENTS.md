# Heart Repository Agent Instructions

## Formatting
Run `make format` before committing changes. This will apply Ruff fixes, isort, Black, docformatter, and mdformat to the Python sources and documentation.

## Testing
Run `make test` to execute the Pytest suite located in the `test/` directory. Ensure all tests pass before submitting changes.

## Linting (Optional Pre-Check)
Running `make check` is recommended to verify formatting and linting without applying fixes.
