"""PhoneText Peripheral (TEXT-ONLY)

This peripheral exposes a single writable BLE characteristic that accepts UTF-8
text messages sent in one or more 20-byte chunks.  Each message must end with a
null terminator (`\0`).  The most-recent message is available via
`PhoneText.get_last_text()` for inspection by other code/tests.
