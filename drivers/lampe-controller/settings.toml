# I think this is correct but can't confirm
# Also all of these variables kinda overlap, might be worth trying to map them more smartly.
# e.g. from CIRCUIT_PY_UF2_URL we know the valid board ID - but this also locks us into only feather express
# from CIRCUIT_PY_BOOT_NAME we pretty much know it is the Feather as well
# We use ValidBoard IDs at a different point, though, to filter out which CIRCUITPY media mounts we should be updating
