# Dithering References

## Problem Statement

Collect resources and constraints for applying dithering techniques to Heart renderers.

## Materials

- Display characteristics for the LED matrix (colour depth, refresh rate).
- Reference implementations for ordered and error-diffusion dithering.
- Visual tests to compare artefacts under different ambient conditions.

## Technical Approach

Review foundational material on dithering to inform potential implementations and evaluate which algorithms align with the device constraints.

## Reference

- [Dithering overview](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dither)

## Notes

Focus on error-diffusion schemes that minimise temporal noise while respecting the limited colour depth of the LED matrix.
