If you want to develop on the Raspberry Pi but you don't have a screen, you can use X11 forwarding to use your macbook as a screen instead.

I had to do the following on an M1 macbook pro:
1. Install XQuartz and restart your computer
2. Run defaults write org.xquartz.X11 enable_iglx -bool true
3. Restart XQuartz
4. On a new terminal run ssh -Y michael@totem.local
5. Run the totem, it should open a window on your laptop and render the screen there
