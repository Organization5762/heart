If you want to develop on the Raspberry Pi but you don't have a screen, you can use X11 forwarding to use your macbook as a screen instead.

# Pi setup

## Setup the PI

On the pi we have to do the following setup:

1. Enable X11 forwarding with sudo raspi-config → Advanced Options → Wayland/X11 → X11
1. Stop WayVNC -> sudo systemctl disable --now wayvnc
1. Enable vnc server instead -> sudo systemctl enable --now vncserver-x11-serviced

# Macbook Setup

## XQuartz setup to work through CLI

1. Install XQuartz and restart your computer
1. Run defaults write org.xquartz.X11 enable_iglx -bool true
1. Restart XQuartz
1. On a new terminal run ssh -Y michael@totem.local
1. Run the totem, it should open a window on your laptop and render the screen there
