If you want to develop on the Raspberry Pi but you don't have a screen, you can use X11 forwarding to use your macbook as a screen instead.

I had to do the following on an M1 macbook pro:

1. Install XQuartz and restart your computer
1. Run defaults write org.xquartz.X11 enable_iglx -bool true
1. Restart XQuartz
1. On a new terminal run ssh -Y michael@totem.local
1. Run the totem, it should open a window on your laptop and render the screen there
