# Linking the RGB Matrix Python Bindings

## Problem Statement

Install the upstream `rpi-rgb-led-matrix` Python bindings on Raspberry Pi hardware so the Heart runtime can stream frames to the LED panel.

## Materials

- Raspberry Pi with network access and sudo privileges.
- Source tree for [`hzeller/rpi-rgb-led-matrix`](https://github.com/hzeller/rpi-rgb-led-matrix/tree/master/bindings/python).
- Terminal configured with `make` and a working Python 3 interpreter.

## Technical Approach

1. Install build dependencies and compile the Python bindings.
1. Disable on-board audio to free the timing circuitry required by the matrix driver.
1. Validate stability by power cycling and exercising the panel after configuration changes.

## Installation Procedure

```bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install python3-dev python3-pillow -y
make build-python PYTHON=$(command -v python3)
sudo make install-python PYTHON=$(command -v python3)
```

## System Configuration

Set `dtparam=audio=off` in `/boot/config.txt` to disable the integrated sound device. If the distribution still loads audio drivers, blacklist `snd_bcm2835`. External USB audio interfaces remain usable.

## Reliability Notes

The display failed once during installation. Reinstalling the driver and rebooting with on-board audio disabled restored normal behaviour. Repeat the boot sequence to ensure the change removes intermittent failures.
