Adopt the upstream [Python bindings](https://github.com/hzeller/rpi-rgb-led-matrix/tree/master/bindings/python) to control the
panel. The following sequence reproduces a clean install on a Raspberry Pi:

```bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install python3-dev python3-pillow -y
make build-python PYTHON=$(command -v python3)
sudo make install-python PYTHON=$(command -v python3)
```

## Disable on-board audio

The RGB matrix driver reuses the same timing circuitry as the integrated audio stack, so the bindings remain stable only after
disabling the default sound device. Update `/boot/config.txt` with `dtparam=audio=off`. On distributions where that is
insufficient, blacklist the `snd_bcm2835` module. External USB audio interfaces continue to function.

## Reliability observations

The display stopped responding once during installation; reinstalling the driver restored normal behaviour. Repeat the boot
sequence with audio disabled to verify that the change removes the intermittent failure.
