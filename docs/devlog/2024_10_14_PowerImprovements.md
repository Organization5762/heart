# Power Explorations

With new [Buck Converters](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1385), it draws 11.3W for an all-white screen.

| Voltage (V) | Current (A) | Power (W) | Number of Screens |
| ----------- | ----------- | --------- | ----------------- |
| 10          | 1.125       | 11.24     | 1                 |
| 17          | 0.666       | 11.32     | 1                 |
| 5           | 1.717       | 8.58      | 1                 |
| 6           | 1.822       | 10.94     | 1                 |

Anything below 5V the screen starts glitching out

# Cable Ribbon

[Example](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/assmann-wsw-components/H3CCS-1636G/999349)

I couldn't find a Cable Ribbon that works with these, which is too bad. In general, seems like there isn't an easy way to extend the cable length.

| Specification       | Value            |
| ------------------- | ---------------- |
| Pitch - Connector   | 0.100" (2.54mm)  |
| Pitch - Cable       | 0.050" (1.27mm)  |
| Length              | 3.00' (914.40mm) |
| Number of Positions | 16               |
| Number of Rows      | 2                |
