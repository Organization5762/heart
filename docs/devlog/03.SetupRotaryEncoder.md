# Rotary Encoder Setup Log

## Problem Statement

Bring the Adafruit Rotary Trinkey online as a scene selection input for the Heart runtime.

## Materials

- Adafruit Rotary Trinkey board and USB cable.
- Workstation with UF2 flashing capability.
- Raspberry Pi target with available USB port.
- Soldering iron and flux for correcting joints.

## Technical Approach

1. Flash CircuitPython onto the Trinkey following Adafruit guidance.
1. Verify enumeration and serial connectivity on the Raspberry Pi.
1. Resolve soldering defects and validate interaction semantics for mode control.

## Firmware Installation

Follow the [Adafruit Rotary Trinkey guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-rotary-trinkey/circuitpython):

- Download the UF2 image from <https://circuitpython.org/board/adafruit_rotary_trinkey_m0/>.
- Copy the UF2 via the terminal to avoid transfer failures.

## Raspberry Pi Verification

- Use `lsusb` and `lsblk` to confirm detection.
- Install `screen` with `sudo apt install screen` for serial inspection.
- Run `dmesg | grep tty` to determine the assigned serial device.

## Hardware Notes

A solder bridge across two pins caused early failures. Reflowing the joints cleared the short and restored rotation without requiring button presses.

## Interaction Experiment

The current prototype maps button presses to mode changes and rotation to intra-mode traversal. Continue usability testing to determine whether additional debouncing or acceleration logic is required.
