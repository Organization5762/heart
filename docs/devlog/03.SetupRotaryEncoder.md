- Connect the rotary encoder Trinkey to a workstation.
- Follow the [Adafruit rotary Trinkey guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-rotary-trinkey/circuitpython).
  - Download the UF2 image from <https://circuitpython.org/board/adafruit_rotary_trinkey_m0/>.
  - Copy the UF2 via the terminal to avoid intermittent transfer failures.

## On the PI

- Use `lsusb` and `lsblk` to confirm device enumeration.
- Install `screen` for quick serial inspection: `sudo apt install screen`.
- Run `dmesg | grep tty` to identify the assigned serial port.

## Soldering

Early failures were due to a solder bridge across two pins; reflowing the joints resolved the short. After cleanup the encoder
rotates without requiring the button to be pressed.

## Integration

Current interaction experiment: pressing the button changes modes, while rotation traverses within the selected mode. Further
usability testing will determine whether we need additional debouncing or acceleration.
