# Multi-Panel Chain Stability

## Problem Statement

Determine why a sixteen-panel chain fails to initialise while two eight-panel chains succeed.

## Materials

- Sixteen LED panels with ribbon cabling.
- Power distribution identical to the eight-panel baseline.
- Instrumentation for monitoring voltage drop and signal integrity.

## Technical Approach

Operate chains of varying lengths, observe boot behaviour, and compare with known-good eight-panel configurations to isolate ribbon cable or signal degradation issues.

## Observations

- Eight-panel chains initialise reliably.
- A single chain of sixteen panels fails to start, implicating ribbon cable integrity or signal loss under higher load.

## Next Steps

Run in parallel using multiple eight-panel chains while measuring signal quality and power distribution to inform cabling redesign for taller assemblies.
