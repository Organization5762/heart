# Driver Installation Baseline

## Problem Statement

Establish a reproducible starting point where the RGB LED matrix responds to vendor diagnostics before integrating the Heart runtime.

## Materials

- Raspberry Pi with the RGB matrix hat attached.
- Network access to follow the Adafruit setup guide.
- Terminal with sudo privileges.

## Technical Approach

Follow the [initial software setup](https://learn.adafruit.com/rgb-led-matrix-cube-for-pi/initial-software-setup) to flash the recommended packages and sample programs. Confirm that the vendor utilities drive the matrix before layering the pygame-based runtime.

## Next Steps

Inspect how the validated driver stack interfaces with the pygame prototype so frames generated by the control loop reach the hardware without additional translation.
