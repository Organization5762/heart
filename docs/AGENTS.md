# Documentation Agent Guidance

Use this guidance for all files under `docs/` unless a nested `AGENTS.md` overrides it.

- Place implementation-ready playbooks and operational plans under `docs/planning/`. These documents should stay focused on concrete execution steps and known delivery patterns.
- Capture exploratory research, speculative designs, or complex work-in-progress analysis under `docs/research/`.
- Keep documentation factual, reference specific modules or scripts where possible, and avoid marketing language.
