# Planning Overview

## Problem Statement

Describe how planning documents in this directory should communicate technical proposals and implementation steps for the Heart project.

## Materials

- Planning templates and AGENTS guidance in this directory.
- Access to related source modules for cross-referencing.

## Technical Approach

Each plan should open with a clear problem statement and materials list, follow the structure defined in `AGENTS.md`, and provide measurable criteria for success so contributors can execute work without ambiguity.

This directory houses detailed plans covering runtime architecture changes, tooling upgrades, and peripheral integration strategies.
