Let's use the Python Bindings:

# Ran:
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install python3-dev python3-pillow -y
make build-python PYTHON=$(command -v python3)
sudo make install-python PYTHON=$(command -v python3)

# Disable Sound
Had to disable the sound to get the test lib working

Switch off on-board sound (dtparam=audio=off in /boot/config.txt). External USB sound adapters work, and are much better quality anyway, so that is recommended if you happen to need sound. The on-board sound uses a timing circuit that the RGB-Matrix needs (it seems in some distributions, such as arch-linux, this is not enough and you need to explicitly blacklist the snd_bcm2835 module).

Hit a hitch where the display stopped working, re-installed the driver and it worked again.  Kinda unclear.  Going to try restarting it now with the sound settings disable to see if we can get that part working first.
